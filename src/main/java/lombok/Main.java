        Step 1: Add the Lombok dependency to your project and configure IntelliJ to support Lombok.

        Step 2: Create a simple class "Student" with the following attributes: id, name, address, grade.

        Step 2.5: Use the appropriate Lombok annotations to generate getters, setters, equals, hashCode, toString, and constructors for the entity.

        Step 3: Create a Teacher record with the following attributes: id, name, subject.

        Step 4: Create a class Course with the following attributes: id, name, teacher, students.

        Step 4.5: Use the appropriate Lombok annotations to generate getters, setters, equals, hashCode, toString, and constructors for the entity.

        Step 5: Write a "Main" class where you apply some examples of creating Students, Teachers, and Courses using the constructors.

        Step 6: In the "Main" class, check if the generated Lombok methods work correctly (getter, setter, toString, ...).

        Step 1: Add the Builder pattern to all entities and create additional objects with the Builder in the main method.
        Step 2: Use the With annotation to facilitate changing properties.

        Bonus:
        *
        Find out what the Lombok annotation @Value does and use it for the Course class.

        Create a record University with the following attributes: id, name, courses.

        Create a class UniversityService and implement the following methods there:

        Write a function to calculate the average grade of a Course (Pass the Course as a parameter).

        Write a function to calculate the average grade of the entire University (Pass a University object as a parameter).

        Write a function that retrieves all students from a University with a minimum grade of 2/"Good" and returns them as a list (Pass a University object as a parameter).
